			<h2>Learning</h2>
			<p>I'm a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp and a less recent graduate of Northwestern University where I studied theatre. In my free time, I've always tried to expand my horizons, be it attempting to learn a new language, catching up on current events, or reading a book.</p>

		<div id="theatre" class="about-container">
		<h2 id='theatre'>Theatre</h2>
			<p>I'm an active actor and artist in Chicago's storefront theatre scene. I've done many things in the past 14 years I've been involved in theatre, including acting, direction, tech-direction, radio and voice-work, and writing. Most recently, I was in the Jeff Award-winning production of "Peyton Place" at City Lit Theatre, directed by Paul Edwards. You can see my other credits <a href="/theatre">here.</a></p>

		<div id="programming" class="about-container">
		<h2 id='programming'>Programming</h2>
			<p>Once upon a time, I took a C++ course in high school with a sprinkling of Java in 2001. In February 2013, I applied to Dev Bootcamp, was accepted, and started learning Ruby. Over the course of 9 weeks at Dev Bootcamp, I've learned Ruby, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, along with jQuery, Rails, Ember, and Sinatra frameworks, RSpec and Jasmine testing, and extended experience with OAuth and Twitter and Facebook APIs.</p>

	<div id="travel" class="about-container">
		<h2 id='travel'>Travel</h2>
		<p>I've always been a huge fan of traveling.  Most recently I traveled throughout western Europe spending a majority of my time in Switzerland visiting a high-school friend, through France, Germany, and England in June while prepping for Dev Bootcamp. (Photos to come)...</p>
